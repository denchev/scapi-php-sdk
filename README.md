### Why?
Because the best way to learn a new API is to write a library for it.

### PHP versions
PHP version 8.1 is the recent version (as of December 2021) with longest active development and support window. It makes no sense to support older versions of PHP as the purpose of SCAPI is to entice merchants to jump into the "new" headless world. Then why should this library support old versions of PHP?
