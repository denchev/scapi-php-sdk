### What is SCAPI
SCAPI stands for Salesforce Commerce API. It is a new generation of APIs to work with Salesforce Commerce Cloud. More info at https://developer.commercecloud.com/s/commerce-api

### Why this library exists?
Because the best way to learn a new API is to write a library for it - from my point of view. From yours - to explore the new API without the boilerplate code.

### PHP versions
PHP version 8.1 is the recent version (as of December 2021) with longest active development and support window. It makes no sense to support older versions of PHP as the purpose of SCAPI is to entice merchants to jump into the "new" headless world. Then why should this library support old versions of PHP?

### Project scope
- Authentication
- Mock service
- Product search
- Unit tests
- Easy integration with PHP Graphql library such as webonyx/graphql-php
